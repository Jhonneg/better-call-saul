            <p>Oh yeah, sure. The Sandpiper settlement—HHM's share will be substantial, absolutely. 
                Even though I humiliated myself. And my clients and peers will whisper that Howard Hamlin's 
                a drug addict. You're right. I've worked my way through worse. Debt. Depression. My marriage 
                falling apart. Oh, yeah. Been sleeping in the guest house for the better part of a year. Just 
                one more thing that good ol' Howard has to work through. But yes, I will land on my feet. I will 
                be okay. But you? Far from it.</p>

                I thought he would be caught if he did. And I told myself I was protecting you. 
                But that's not the truth. The real reason I didn't tell you was because I knew 
                what you'd do.</p>
