    <p>Stir in any of the following at the end of cooking: pecans, orange zest, raisins, currants, blueberries, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice.</p>
     <p>For a stronger orange flavor, decrease the amount of water in the recipe to 1/2 cup and add 1/2 cup orange juice.</p>
        <p>For a reduced-sugar cranberry sauce, use half the amount of sugar called for, then taste and add more as needed.</p> 
    <p>Also reduce the amount of water to 1/2 cup, adding more as needed if the sauce seems too thick.</p>
<p>To make sugar-free cranberry sauce, substitute a sugar replacer like Splenda or Truvia for the sugar.</p>
